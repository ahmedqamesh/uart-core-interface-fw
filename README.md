# Verilog UART Implementation for FPGA
## Description
The Verilog code provided here implements the functionality of a UART interface, allowing for serial communication over a UART protocol. The UART interface includes modules for transmitting and receiving data asynchronously, handling start and stop bits, and generating baud rate clocks.

## Files
- debug_uart_core_struct.v: Defines the structure of the UART core.
- debug_uart_receiver.v: Implements the receiver module for UART communication.
- debug_uart_sm_fsm.v: Implements the state machine for UART communication.
- debug_uart_transmitter.v: Implements the transmitter module for UART communication.
- fifo_async.v: Implements an asynchronous FIFO (First-In-First-Out) buffer for data transmission and reception.
- fifo_mem.v: Implements a memory-based FIFO buffer for data transmission and reception.
- fifo_rptr_empty.v: Implements logic to indicate if the read pointer of the FIFO buffer is empty.
- fifo_sync_r2w.v: Implements synchronization logic for read-to-write operations in the FIFO buffer.
- fifo_sync_w2r.v: Implements synchronization logic for write-to-read operations in the FIFO buffer.
- fifo_wptr_full.v: Implements logic to indicate if the write pointer of the FIFO buffer is full.
- mux8_1_8bit.v: Implements an 8-bit multiplexer.
- timeoutrst_module.v: Implements a timeout reset module.

## Usage
This Verilog code can be synthesized and implemented on FPGA development boards using tools like Xilinx Vivado (currently v2020.2 is used) or Intel Quartus Prime. Once synthesized, the FPGA can be configured to act as a UART interface for serial communication with other digital devices.

## Example Application
- Interfacing with sensors and actuators: Use the UART interface to communicate with sensors and actuators in embedded systems.
- Communication with microcontrollers: Establish serial communication between the FPGA and microcontrollers for data exchange.
- Debugging and monitoring: Implement UART communication for debugging and monitoring purposes, allowing for real-time data transmission and analysis.

## Notes
- Ensure that the Verilog code is compatible with the target FPGA device and synthesis toolchain.
- Customize the UART configuration (baud rate, data bits, parity, stop bits) according to the specific requirements of the application.
- Verify the functionality of the UART interface through simulation and testing before deploying it in hardware.

# Rebuild Project Instructions

To rebuild the UART core interface project, follow these steps:

1. Open the terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory where the `uart_core_interface_build.tcl` script is located.

3. Execute the following command to rebuild the project:

```
source uart_core_interface_build.tcl
```
4. Wait for the script to execute. The script will recreate the Vivado project with the specified settings and configurations.
